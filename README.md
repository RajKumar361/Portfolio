# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This project represents my learning journey, technical growth, and hands-on experience in web development.

## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio website was built using **Lovable AI**, an AI-powered development platform that helps convert ideas into functional, production-ready web applications. By describing the layout, sections, and features, I was able to iteratively build a complete portfolio website efficiently.

Along with AI assistance, the core learning, guidance, and conceptual clarity came from **Tap Academy**, where I am currently doing my internship.
